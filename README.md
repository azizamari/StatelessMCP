# StatelessMCP ðŸ§© 

**An experimental, stateless approach to AI agent integration for serverless environments.**

StatelessMCP is an open-source exploration into simplifying how AI agents interact with tools and APIs. By focusing on stateless design and compatibility with REST APIs, this project aims to make AI agent integration more lightweight, scalable, and serverless-friendly.

---

## **Why StatelessMCP?**

- **Exploration**: This project is an experiment to see if a stateless deployment of MCP is viable, especially in light of the recent wide adoption of this Protocol.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to work with REST APIs, the industry standard for data integration.
- **Scalability**: Built for serverless environments, reducing overhead and complexity.

---

## **Goals**

1. **Experiment**: Explore whether a stateless, serverless-friendly approach to AI agent integration is feasible and useful.
2. **Scale**: Once we validate the need for this project, next features will depend on community suggestions.  

---

## **Getting Started**

The initial Proof of Concept (POC) version of StatelessMCP will be released by the **end of this month**. This is an experimental release to gather feedback and validate the approach.

## **Contributor Guide**

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a developer, designer, or AI enthusiast, there's a place for you in this project.
For now let's use github's discussion feature for now and once I publish the POC we'll setup an into call and slack or discord community.

## **Note from the Maintainer**

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹  
This project is an experiment to explore whether a stateless, serverless-friendly approach to AI agent integration is viable. Iâ€™m currently juggling a few other projects, so my time is a bit limited. However, Iâ€™m committed to releasing the initial POC by the **end of this month**. Your patience, feedback, and support mean a lot, and Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with all of you to see where this goes!

## **Roadmap**

- **v0.1 (POC)**: Initial experimental release with basic stateless implementation (end of this month).
- **v0.2**: Gather feedback and iterate on the design.
- **v0.3**: Explore integration with serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) and publish documentation.
- **v1.0**: If validated, release a stable version based on community feedback.
